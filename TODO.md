# TODO

- [x] Wire the shared strictness and file-skipping helper (`src/utils/rule-options.ts`) into the rules that need configurability.
- [x] Update affected rule schemas and documentation to describe the new options.
- [x] Extend regression tests to cover relaxed vs strict thresholds and file skipping behavior.
