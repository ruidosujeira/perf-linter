# Security Policy

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 0.4.x   | ✅        |
| < 0.4   | ❌        |

Only the latest minor release receives security fixes. Please upgrade before filing a report.

## Reporting a vulnerability

1. Open a private advisory at <https://github.com/ruidosujeira/perf-linter/security/advisories/new> with as much detail as possible.
2. If you prefer email, write to `security@perf-fiscal.dev` using the same content. Encrypting with PGP is optional; include a public disclosure timeline if you have one.
3. Expect an acknowledgement within 3 business days and an initial response with triage results within 7 business days.

## Disclosure expectations

- We coordinate on a fix before any public disclosure.
- Once a patch is available, we will credit reporters (unless you request otherwise) in the changelog and GitHub release notes.
- Please avoid filing public GitHub issues for security problems; use the private channel above instead.
