# Community Maintenance Playbook

Perf Fiscal thrives when our community program runs consistently. Use this checklist to keep weekly audits, discussions, and onboarding pathways healthy.

## 1. Scheduling the Weekly Audit
- **Set a reminder:** Block 30 minutes every Monday morning to compile last week's activity (covering Monday–Sunday).
- **Collect inputs:** Review merged pull requests, active issues (especially `good first issue` and `boa primeira contribuição`), and top GitHub Discussions.
- **Draft outline:** Copy `.github/weekly-audit-report.md` into a new discussion post or repository note.

## 2. Publishing the Report
- **Create a Discussion:** Post the summary in the "Announcements" category so it pings watchers and followers.
- **Add links:** Reference standout discussions, issues, and contributor shoutouts to encourage clicks.
- **Tag maintainers:** Mention reviewers or mentors who can answer follow-up questions.

## 3. Promoting Participation
- **Cross-post:** Share the highlight reel in Slack, Discord, or social media to invite new contributors.
- **Update README badges:** Ensure the Contributing section still points to Discussions, `good first issue`, and audit archives.
- **Surface templates:** Link the "boa primeira contribuição" issue template when recruiting mentors or new maintainers.

## 4. Following Up After Publication
- **Respond promptly:** Monitor the discussion thread for the first 48 hours and answer clarifying questions.
- **Label issues:** Apply `boa primeira contribuição` or `good first issue` labels as new ideas surface during the week.
- **Archive learnings:** Add noteworthy outcomes to internal docs or future roadmap planning.

## 5. Quarterly Health Check
- **Evaluate cadence:** Confirm that at least 10 of the last 12 weeks have published reports. Adjust staffing if not.
- **Refresh templates:** Review `.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE` and issue templates to keep prompts relevant.
- **Celebrate wins:** Use the audit to champion contributors in release notes or community calls.

Maintain this playbook alongside the README to give future maintainers clarity on how to sustain the community program.
